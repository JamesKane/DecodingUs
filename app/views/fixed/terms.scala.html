        <h1>TODO:  This needs to be over-hauled for the new site</h1>
        
        <h1>Data Policy</h1>
        <p>
            This policy was created to balance the rights and privacy of individuals, with the benefit to the whole
            community of gathering information for their research projects. We have tried to ensure the safety and
            privacy of any personal data, including data likely to have significant medical relevance, or which can
            identify a specific person. At the same time, we have tried to retain enough information that test results
            are useful for research, meaningful for close matches and can be cross-referenced against information on
            other sites.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The following is the Policy agreed to on upload of data, between Submitters of that data (genetic
                testers or their designated proxies) and the Project. The Project is defined as those persons with
                administrative access to the data archive, or successors thereof.
            </li>
            <li>Submitters give the Project free license to analyse the genetic and ancestral data they submit, and
                publicly release semi-anonymized and filtered analyses of that data. Records may be combined with data from
                public domain sources, including any associable Y-STR and genealogical records. Released genetic data is to
                be limited to calls assigned to the Y-chromosome.
            </li>

            <li>Raw DNA sequencing data (e.g. BAM or FASTQ datasets) will only be shared with a member&#39;s explicit
                written consent. However, reduced sets of Y-chromosome data (including calls in VCF/gVCF format, test
                coverage information in BED format, and submitted meta-data) may be shared with co-operating projects.
            </li>

            <li>Tests are publicly identified by the meta-data supplied on submission, i.e. kit numbers and most-distant
                known paternal ancestor information. Project members may request that public reports anonymize all or
                part of this information to an internal project identifier instead. Such requests should be made by
                e-mail before submission to prevent public release of information.
            </li>

            <li>Submitters or legal data owners have the right to request that their raw data is removed from the data
                analysis at any time. However, since we release a reduced set of data into the public domain, we cannot
                guarantee these data are removed from external sites once the kit has been analyzed.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Project may contact Submitters about specific queries regarding their data, using the e-mail address
                supplied on submission. Sharing of e-mail addresses with any third parties will only be done with
                Submitters&#39; consent.
            </li>
            <li>
                Minor updates to this agreement may be necessary, e.g. to modify or make explicit the names of people
                and parties; to include new data formats; to clarify specific points of ambiguity; or to ensure
                compliance with national and international law, existing privacy agreements with testing companies,
                or community guidelines. Such changes may me made by the Project without notification, provided they
                don&#39;t constitute material infringements of the rights and/or privacy granted to Submitters, as described
                in the version of the Policy they initially accept.
